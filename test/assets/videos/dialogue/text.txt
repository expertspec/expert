 Good afternoon, you must be Mr. Wang. Yes, good afternoon. Please to meet you, I'm Mrs. Clark the Bank Manager. Please, have a seat. Thank you. So, tell me a little bit about yourself, Mr. Wang. Well, I grew up in China and studied accounting. Then I worked at an accounting firm there for two years before coming to the States. I work well with others, and I like to challenge myself to constantly improve my skills. That's great. As you know, this job is for a bank teller. What would you say are some of your strengths or skills that might help you succeed in this job? My biggest strength is my attention to detail. That has helped me a lot in this line of work. Also, I work well under pressure. Wonderful. And what would you say are some of your weaknesses? One of my biggest weaknesses is asking for help when I need it. I'd like to do better at that. I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Wang. What can you tell me about some of your goals over the next few years? My primary goal is to gain more work experience. So a position like this would help me meet that goal. I'd also like to learn more about the different aspects of banking. I think those goals are very smart. I also want to ask you what salary range you'd be most comfortable with. I would be hoping to start somewhere between $35,000 and $38,000 a year, which is based on my experience and education. Thank you. Those are all the questions I have for you today. Do you have any questions for me? Can you tell me about the working hours? We'd like whoever fills the position to work 9-5 each week day. There may be some occasional overtime. All right. Thank you. And when do you expect to be making your decision? We'll give you a call within a week and let you know. Do you have any other questions? Not at the moment. Thank you. Well, if you think of any more, you're always welcome to call me. Thank you so much. It was great to meet you. Thanks for coming in today. Thank you. It was a pleasure meeting you as well.
