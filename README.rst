**Expert** - is an open-source technology that is designed to assess the validity of expert opinion based on dynamic video content mining.

Expert Features
==========================================================

Service "EXPERT" is designed to assess the consistency of expert opinion based on various parameters obtained by multimodal analysis of audio, video and text data. This development can be applied in the field of education and online learning, HR processes, issues related to the analysis of information of social and political nature.

Expert Applications
==========================================================

- **Authenticity** - is a characteristic that allows us to evaluate the level of consistency of information simultaneously transmitted by a person verbally and non-verbally (audio, video and textual channels).
- **Aggression** - is a qualitative characteristic of a person's attitude toward someone or something, expressed in a state of hostility, ill-will, aggression, anger toward the object of hostility.
- **Confidence** - is a characteristic that allows us to evaluate a property of personality, the core of which is a positive assessment of an individual's own skills and abilities as sufficient to achieve goals meaningful to him and meet his needs.
- **Contradiction** - is a characteristic that allows us to evaluate two statements of which one is the negation of the other. If two statements are in a contradictory relation, then one of them is equivalent to the negation of the other.
- **Transcribe**
- **Summarize**

Requirements
==========================================================

- Python ~=3.9 (python3.9-full, python3.9-dev)
- pip >=21.0 or PDM ~=2.4.8

Installation
==========================================================

Describe how users can install your project.

Expert can be installed with ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install "expert[all] @ git+https://github.com/expertspec/expert.git"

or with ``pdm``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pdm add "expert[all] @ git+https://github.com/expertspec/expert.git"

The ``expert[all]`` entry means that dependencies from the ``all`` group will be installed. 
If you want to install dependencies only from a group of a certain library module, 
then enter the name of the required module instead of ``all``. 
Installing without specifying a dependency group will result in installing a library 
without dependencies

How to Use
==========================================================

Describe examples how it should work and should be used.
Images, GIFs and code cells are welcome.
Examples & Tutorials

Development
==========================================================

Clone repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/expertspec/expert.git

Install all dependencies from ``pdm.lock`` file:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pdm install

or optional dependencies for each library module (check ``pyproject.toml``):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pdm install -G <group>

Run pre-commited hooks:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pre-commit run (all hooks only for commited changes)
    $ pre-commit run --all-files (all hooks for all changes)
    $ pre-commit run <hook_name> (specified hook)
