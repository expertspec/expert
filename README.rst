Expert Applications
==========================================================

- **Authenticity** - is a characteristic that allows us to evaluate the level of consistency of information simultaneously transmitted by a person verbally and non-verbally (audio, video and textual channels).
- **Aggression** - is a qualitative characteristic of a person's attitude toward someone or something, expressed in a state of hostility, ill-will, aggression, anger toward the object of hostility.
- **Confidence** - is a characteristic that allows us to evaluate a property of personality, the core of which is a positive assessment of an individual's own skills and abilities as sufficient to achieve goals meaningful to him and meet his needs.
- **Contradiction** - is a characteristic that allows us to evaluate two statements of which one is the negation of the other. If two statements are in a contradictory relation, then one of them is equivalent to the negation of the other.
- **Transcribe**
- **Summarize**
